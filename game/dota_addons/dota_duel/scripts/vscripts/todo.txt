find way to change facets:
- create bot for each hero with debugcreateherowithvariant and swap player to it
- hide existing heroes/players in all functions and UI
- add hooks to hero select screen to detect facet choice
- disconnect bots after each debugcreateherowithvariant call to reuse player IDs

bots:
- implement thinkers:
  - implement other bots
- general logic and utilities:

- fix stat tracking
- setup vote UI
- add notes to update.txt
